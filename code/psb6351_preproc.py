# NODE 11: SPATIAL SMOOTHING
# You have a couple of options here...
# If you want to smooth isotropically you can use either AFNI's 3dmerge or FSL's fslmath
# For AFNI's implementation within the context of nipype check out the following page:
# https://nipype.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/generated/nipype.interfaces.afni.utils.html#nipype.interfaces.afni.utils.Merge
# For FSL's implementation within the context of nipype check out hte following page:
# https://nipype.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/generated/nipype.interfaces.fsl.utils.html#nipype.interfaces.fsl.utils.Smooth
# QUESTIONS TO ANSWER...
# Q1 - What does isotropic mean?
# MY ANSWER: Isotropic means being the same, regardless of which direction it is measured.
# The Gaussian kernel has the same FWHM in the x, y, and z directions. It is applied the
# same way everywhere in the brain, no matter what tissue type it is.
#
# Q2 - What are the pros and cons of isotropic spatial smoothing?
# MY ANSWER: There are many pros and cons of isotropic spatial smoothing. Some of the pros include
# that it raises SNR, because random noise averages out while real signal is spatially correlated.
# Another advantage is that it helps the overlapping of activations across subjects in group analyses.
# This helps the data fit the Gaussian Random Field assumptions, which is used for multiple comparison
# correction. It is also simple and fast. Some of the cons include it blurring tissue boundaries so signals mix. 
# This is bad as one loses spatial specificity, so that small activations tend to get washed out, separate
# regions will sometimes merge, and the peak locations can shift as well.
#
# AFNI has some cool tools to help control the final smoothness of your data
# Specifically 3dBlurToFWHM, this function will estimate your intrinsic smoothness and iteratively
# spatially blur up until it achieves a targeted smoothness
# Q3 - Why might this be good?  Are there any potential cons?
# MY ANSWER: 3dBlurToFWHM may be good to use as different sets of data start with different intrinsic smoothness 
# Blurring to a specific target means that every dataset will end at the same final smoothness. This can be very 
# beneficial when wanting to compare results across subjects and sites. The smoothness-based stats would then be 
# consistent. Some cons include it being slow, especially with the big targets. It can only add smoothness, so if 
# that data are already smoother than the target, it can not fix that. It would still blur across tissue boundaries 
# like regular smoothing does.
#
# If you intend to use AFNI's 3dBlurToFWHM check out hte following page:
# https://nipype.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/generated/nipype.interfaces.afni.preprocess.html#nipype.interfaces.afni.preprocess.BlurToFWHM
# NOTE: If you elect to use this one be careful on how big you make your
# kernel as this process is iterative and can take some time
# FSL has some cool tools that help ensure that you spatially smooth like voxels
# This is FSL's SUSAN algorithm, this function will use intensities in voxels
# to constrain smoothing to like intensities (smooth only grey matter with grey matter)
# Q4 - Why might this be good? Cons (hint: begins with an 'e' and ends with 'ge' effects)?
#      How might the cons influence Gaussian Random Field Theory?
# MY ANSWER: SUSAN is good in the way that it is edge-preserving. It only averages a voxel with neighboring voxels 
# with similar brightness, so that gray matter gets smoothed with other gray matter and is not mixed with CSF or 
# white matter. Basically, with this tool, you get noise reduction while keeping spatial detail. Cons of this 
# include edge effects, that it smooths near tissue boundaries less than in the middle of the tissue. The amount 
# of smoothing varies across the brain, instead of it being uniform. This is an issue in terms of the Gaussian Random 
# Field Theory as it assumes that smoothness is the same everywhere in the image. With SUSAN this is simply not true, 
# so the multiple comparison corrections based on it can be inaccurate. 

#
# If you choose an isotropic approach or AFNI's 3dBlurToFWHM you need
# to add just a single node here.
#
# If you choose to use the FSL SUSAN approach, you'll need to add the following
# NODE 1 - FreeSurferSource node, define subjects_dir as the project's freesurfer directory
#          and define subject_id as the subject id
# NODE 2 - You will need to make a brain only mask.  I'm going to guide you to use freesurfers aparc+aseg
#          To do this you'll use freesurfer's binarize function
#          binarizing all values in the aparc+aseg file that are greater than 0.5
#          For this node to work connect the fssource node and in the connection syntax
#          imbed the get_aparc_aseg function that is already defined for you above
#          Use this node to also dilate your brian only mask in T1w space by 1 voxel
# NODE 3 - Now you have a brain only mask in T1w space...you need to move this into the
#          EPI space by applying the volume transform from T1w space into EPI space
#          NOTE: This step is best implemented if you used Freesurfer's BBREGISTER for coregistration
#          You have to define where you're going aka 'source_file' and what is moving aka 'target_file'
#          You have to pass the registration matrix file derived from your coregistration node
#          You also have to choose an interpolation...
# Q5 - why is nearest neighbor interpolation correct here? What is nearest neighbor interpolation?
# MY ANSWER: The nearest neighbor interpolation is when an image is moved into a new space. During this, each new voxel 
# takes the value of the closest original voxel, and does not average between voxels. The reason the nearest neighbor 
# interpolation may be best here is because the mask is binary, only using 0s and 1s. Other methods would average
# neighbors and create in between values, such as 0.4 along the edges, so it would not be binary anymore. Nearest neighbors 
# keep it at 0 or 1. 
#
# NODE 4 - Now use the mask that is in EPI space to mask the EPI image by voxels that only cover the brain
#          you can use FSL's fslmaths and the '-mas' flag to work here
# NODE 5 - Get the median of your EPI data using FSL's fslmath with the following op_string = '-k %s -p 50'
# NODE 6 - Get the mean of your EPI data using FSL's fslmath with the following op_string = '-Tmean'
# NODE 7 - Use Nipype's util.Merge function to take in 2 inputs and horizontal stack the (aka., 'hstack')
#          Define your first input as the mean EPI from NODE 6 and your second input as the median EPI from NODE 5
# NODE 8 - Now you have all you need to implement the SUSAN smooth node
#          Pass a list of variable smoothing kernel FWHM sizes, use a mapnode to iterate over them
#          What else needs to be in your iterfield?
# NODE DATASINK - Modify your datasink node to collect the smoothed output files so you can visualize

# NODE 12: TEMPORAL FILTERING OR SMOOTHING
# I want you to add a node here to temporally filter the functional data --> should this be a mapnode or regular node?
# MY ANSWER: A MapNode, because there are multiple functional runs and each
#            run has to be filtered separately.
# If the functional EPI data are resting state data I want you to implement a 
# bandpass filter. If the functional EPI data are task data I want you to implement
# a highpass filter.
# Q6 - why bandpass resting state but only highpass task EPI data?
# MY ANSWER: Bandpass resting state but only highpass task EPI data because with resting state there is no task, and the signal 
# that we are looking at is typically slow spontaneous fluctuations. A bandpass removes slow drift below that range and faster noise
# above it, such as breathing and heartbeat. When it comes to task data, the task related signal can contain faster frequencies, 
# especially in event related designs, so a low pass filter can remove real task signal. This is why it is important to only remove
# the slow drift with a high pass filter whose cutoff is slower than the task's timing. 
#
# I want you to utilize either the FSL tools implementing fslmaths, what op_string flag would you need?
# MY ANSWER: -bptf <highpass sigma> <lowpass sigma>, with -1 for the lowpass
#            sigma so only the highpass filter is applied.
# https://nipype.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/generated/nipype.interfaces.fsl.utils.html#nipype.interfaces.fsl.utils.ImageMaths
# Or you can use AFNI's 3dBandpass function
# https://nipype.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/generated/nipype.interfaces.afni.preprocess.html#nipype.interfaces.afni.preprocess.Bandpass
# If you use AFNI's tool and you only highpass filter, how do you set your fbot and ftop?
# If you are electing to use the Discrete Cosine Tranforms (DCTs) to statistically account for low frequency noise
# you'll need to run a regression model.
# For this step I would recommend utilizing AFNI's 3dDeconvolve paired with 3dREMLfit
# First using 3dDeconvolve you'll need to 
# define your legendre input as True and your number of polorts as an integer - try 7..
# you can also make the x1D_stop flag True as you don't need to run the 3dDeconvolve as 3dREMLfit does the heavy lifting here
# create another node for the 3dREMLfit passing the x1D matrix from the 3dDeconvolve node and save in your datasink the residuals

# fslmaths wants the cutoff as a sigma in VOLUMES, not seconds:
#   sigma = cutoff / (2 * TR) = 128 s / (2 * 1.76 s) = 36.36 volumes
# -bptf also removes each voxel's mean, so the mean image is added back
# afterward (-add) to keep the data at its original intensity.
# I filtered the masked, unsmoothed runs so the effect of the filter can be
# seen on its own, separate from smoothing (this also saves disk space).
